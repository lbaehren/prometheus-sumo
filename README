== Introduction

"prometheus-sumo" is a simple (almost) virtual package, to ease the retrieval of
the various components in the software stack for "prometheus – The Distributed
Digital Image Archive for Research and Studies".

prometheus (www.prometheus-bildarchiv.de) is a digital image archive for Art and
Cultural Sciences. prometheus enables the convenient search for images on a
common user interface within different image archives, variable databases from
institutes, research facilities and museums.


== External dependencies

External dependencies are kept to a minimum for this package:

* Git   (>= 1.7) <http://git-scm.com>
* CMake (>= 2.8) <http://www.cmake.org>

Further dependencies, as required when developing the prometheus software
packages, are handled as part of this tool.


== Organization of the source code

Once cloning into a working copy has completed, the following directory structure
can be found:

  .
  |-- CMakeLists.txt          ...  Top-level CMake script for the project
  |-- README                  ...  This README file
  |-- config
  |   |-- cmake               ...  Collection of CMake scripts and modules

  |-- environment             ...  Environment preparation scripts
  |   `-- CMakeLists.txt
  |-- repositories            ...  Working copies of related projects
  `-- sources                 ...  Source files


== Configuration options

The behaviour and processing can - to a certain degree - be controlled when
running CMake to configure the project; the list below shows the available 
options which can be passed along through the

  -D<Option>=<Value>

syntax from the command line. At the moment the following options are available
(default values in parenthesis):

    TESTING_ENABLE        "Enable CTest test driver?"                    [ YES ]
    CONFIGURE_VERBOSE     "Increase verbosity during configuration?"     [ NO  ]
    DOCUMENTATION_PANDORA "Enable documentation of pandora source code?" [ YES ]
