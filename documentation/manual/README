NOTE:

  While most of the general documentation has been set up to work with multiple
  documentation generation tools, it was found that when trying to generate information
  organized as a manual, none of the tools available for the Ruby programming language
  would be able to provide functionality matching that of Doxygen. Hence it was decided
  to deviate from the earlier practice and have the source files for the manual set up
  in such a way to optimize the resulting output when processed through Doxygen.
