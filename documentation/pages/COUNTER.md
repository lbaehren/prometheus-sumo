\section counter_general General information

COUNTER (Counting Online Usage of NeTworked Electronic Resources) was formally established in March 2002. Release 1 of the COUNTER Code of Practice for Journals and Databases was launched in December 2002. COUNTER serves librarians, vendors, intermediaries and others by facilitating the recording and exchange of online usage statistics. The COUNTER Code of Practice provides guidance on data elements to be measured, definitions of these data elements, output report content and format, as well as on data processing and auditing. To have their usage statistics and reports designated COUNTER- compliant vendors must provide usage statistics that conform to the Code of Practice.

\subsection counter_general_purpose Purpose

The purpose of the COUNTER Code of Practice is to facilitate the recording, exchange and interpretation of online usage data by establishing open, international standards and protocols for the provision of vendor-generated usage statistics that are consistent, credible and compatible.

\subsection counter_general_scope Scope

This COUNTER Code of Practice provides a framework for the recording and exchange of online sage statistics for the major categories of e-resources (journals, databases, books, reference works, multimedia databases) at an international level. In doing so, it covers the following areas: data elements to be measured; definitions of these data elements; content and format of usage reports; requirements for data processing; requirements for auditing; guidelines to avoid duplicate counting when intermediary gateways and aggregators are used.

\subsection counter_general_application Application

COUNTER is designed for librarians, vendors, intermediaries and others who require reliable online usage statistics. The guidelines provided by this Code of Practice enable librarians to compare statistics from different vendors, to make better-informed purchasing decisions, and to plan infrastructure more effectively. COUNTER also provides vendors/intermediaries with the detailed specifications they need to generate data in a format useful to customers, to compare the relative usage of different delivery channels, and to learn more about online usage patterns. COUNTER also provides guidance to others interested in information about online usage statistics.

\section counter_release4 Release 4

COUNTER provides an international, extendible Code of Practice for e-Resources that allows the usage of online information products and services to be measured in a credible, consistent and compatible way using vendor- generated data. Release 4 is an integrated Code of Practice covering journals, databases, books, reference works and multimedia content. It replaces both Release 3 of the Code of Practice for Journals and Databases and Release 1 of the Code of Practice for Books and Reference Works. The deadline date for implementation of Release 4 is 31 December 2013. After this date only those vendors compliant with Release 4 will be considered to be COUNTER compliant; vendors are encouraged to implement Release 4 before that date. Before 31 December 2013, only vendors compliant with the new Release 4, or vendors compliant with Release 3 for Journals and Databases or Release 1 for Books and Reference Works will be considered to be COUNTER-compliant.
