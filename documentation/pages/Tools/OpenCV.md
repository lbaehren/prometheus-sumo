\section opencv_about About

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions
mainly aimed at real-time computer vision, developed by Intel, and now supported
by Willow Garage and Itseez. It is free for use under the open source BSD license.
The library is cross-platform. It focuses mainly on real-time image processing.
If the library finds Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives on the system, it
will use these proprietary optimized routines to accelerate itself.

OpenCV is released under a BSD license, it is free for both academic and
commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and soon Java interfaces running on
Windows, Linux, Android and Mac. The library has >2500 optimized algorithms. It
is used around the world, has >2.5M downloads and >40K people in the user group.
Uses range from interactive art, to mine inspection, stitching maps on the web
on through advanced robotics. 

\section opencv_programming Programming languages

OpenCV is written in C++ and its primary interface is in C++, but it still retains
a less comprehensive though extensive older C interface. There are now full
interfaces in Python, Java and MATLAB/OCTAVE (as of version 2.5). The API for
these interfaces can be found in the online documentation. Wrappers in other
languages such as C#, Ch, Ruby have been developed to encourage adoption by a
wider audience.

All of the new developments and algorithms in OpenCV are now developed in the C++
interface. A CUDA-based GPU interface has been in progress since September 2010.
