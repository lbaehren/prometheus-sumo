\tableofcontents

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) is a global e-commerce business allowing
payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. Online money
transfers serve as electronic alternatives to paying with traditional paper
methods, such as checks and money orders.

PayPal is an acquirer, performing payment processing for online vendors, auction
sites, and other commercial users, for which it charges a fee. It may also charge
a fee for receiving money, proportional to the amount received. The fees depend
on the currency used, the payment option used, the country of the sender, the
country of the recipient, the amount sent and the recipient's account type. In
addition, eBay purchases made by credit card through PayPal may incur extra fees
if the buyer and seller use different currencies.
