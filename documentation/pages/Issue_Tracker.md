\section issue_tracker_usage Usage

\subsection issue_tracker_navigation Navigation

The screenshot below shows the main navigation elements available, to find your
way around inside the issue tracker:

\image html Redmine__Navigation.png

\li The _Global navigation_ navigation is available from any page within the issue tracker, hence providing the means to e.g. jump back to the starting page.
  - <b>Home</b> provides a shortcut to go back to the start page of the Issue Tracker.
  - <b>My page</b> provides a shortcut to jump to a user-customizable page.
  - The \b Projects page provides an overview of all the projects currently tracked within the local Redmine installation.
  - Given appropriate permissions, *Administration* allows to gain access to the administration settings of the Redmine installation.
\li If you are logged in via a registered _user account_, this fact will be displayed in the right half of the top navigation frame.
  - "My Account":/redmine/my/account will grant access to the settings allowing for a customization of the way Redmine will behave for you (e.g. mail subscription to changes, etc.)
\li The services available for a project are provided through a number of _modules_; which of theses are enabled/disabled can be modified with the menus behind the *Settings* tab. Disabling a module doesn't delete the associated data. It only prevents users from accessing it. After a module was disabled, it can be re-enabled with all its data.
  - *Actvity* points to a page collecting messages generated by the various activities as part of a project; depending on the settings this includes commit messages (when submitting changes to the code repository), updates to the tracked issues, etc.
  - If issues are collected into milestones (e.g. a release version), a total for the *Roadmap* is displayed, so you can easily check the whole project status. The issues of the versions are shown as a table instead as a list, with more information about the time (completed and due) with real status calculated based on the duration, the current completion percentage and the consequent estimation of the due time. These issues are printed with color (red: the task is over due, orange: over due but not so bad as red, black: normal, green: the issue is been solved faster than the estimation).
  - List of tracked *Issues* for a project - see section \ref redmine_usage_issues below for further details.
  - Create a *New issue* to be tracked.
  - *Calendar* view of the tracked issued; if due dates are defined, these will be marked in the calendar as well.
  - Redmine allows to a set up a *Wiki* for each of the hosted projects, where additional documentation can be placed (such as e.g. this page).
    - If a selected project has *Subprojects*, these will automatically listed here.
    - *Issue tracking* provides a shortcut to the various types of issues currently being tracked for the project.

\subsection redmine_usage_issues The Issue list

  As long as the module "Issue Tracking" is enabled for a project (which it is
  by default), the issue list provides a way to look at the opened issues for a project.

  The issue list displays open issues by default. Standard and custom fields can be used to build a custom query.

  \li \b Filters [1] can be used to defined a custom query on the global issue list,
  e.g. selection issues assigned to a an individual person or due until a certain date.
  \li \b Options [2] allow modification of the way in which the (filtered) issue list is
  being displayed, allowing to reduce/increase the amount of information returned per
  individual issue.
  \li Once the filters are set, there are three options [3] how to continue:
  - \b Apply the filters to the issue list.
  - \b Clear the previously filters, reinstating the default view on the issue list.
  - \b Save the results obtained from applying the filters.
