\section icinga_about About

Icinga is an enterprise grade open source monitoring system which keeps watch
over networks and any conceivable network resource, notifies the user of errors
and recoveries and generates performance data for reporting. Scalable and
extensible, Icinga can monitor complex, large environments across dispersed
locations.

Icinga is a fork of \ref nagios and is backward compatible. So, Nagios
configurations, plugins and addons can all be used with Icinga. Though Icinga
retains all the existing features of its predecessor, it builds on them to add
many long awaited patches and features requested by the user community.
